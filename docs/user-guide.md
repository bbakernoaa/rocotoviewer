# User Guide

This guide provides a detailed walkthrough of the RocotoViewer interface and its features.

## Interface Overview

RocotoViewer's interface is divided into three main sections:

1.  **Sidebar (Cycle Tree)**: Displays a hierarchical view of workflow cycles and their tasks. Each cycle can be expanded to see its tasks with icons and color-coded status (e.g., ✅ for SUCCEEDED, 🏃 for RUNNING, 💀 for DEAD).
2.  **Selected Task Status**: A concise table showing the status of the currently selected task, including Job ID, State, Exit code, Tries, and Duration.
3.  **Inspection Panel (Tabbed)**: A tabbed container for detailed task information.
    - **Details Tab**: Displays comprehensive information about the task, including command, log paths, and dependencies.
    - **Log Tab**: Shows a live tail of the task's log file.
4.  **Status Bar**: Displays the "Path" to the currently selected item (e.g., Workflow > Cycle > Task).

## Key Bindings

## Task Filtering

You can quickly find specific tasks using the filter input at the top of the main content area. Type any part of a task name to filter the visible tasks in the Cycle Tree.

## Auto-Refresh

By default, RocotoViewer automatically refreshes the workflow status every 30 seconds. This ensures you have the latest information without manual intervention.

## Inspecting Task Details

When you select a task in the Cycle Tree, the Details tab in the inspection panel updates with specific information for that task instance. This includes:

- **Resolved Paths**: Log paths and commands are automatically resolved based on the cycle.
- **Resource Usage**: Account, Queue, Walltime, and Memory requirements if specified.
- **Dependencies**: A list of task dependencies and their current status.

## Log Viewing

RocotoViewer allows you to view task logs directly within the TUI. When a task is selected, you can switch to the **Log** tab (or press `l`) to see the log. If the log file exists, it will be loaded and tailed in real-time.

By default, **Follow mode** is enabled, meaning the view will automatically scroll as new content is added to the log. You can toggle this behavior by pressing `f`.
